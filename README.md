# Library

A [Library](https://atwycodes.github.io/library/) project to practice usage of Constructors, Linting, Protypal Inheritance and DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript.

Concepts explored & practiced include:
* Defining of objects using constructors
* Defining of object.methods and attaching them to object prototypes for inheritance
* DOM manipulation
* Usage of a linter during development to decrease code verbosity.
